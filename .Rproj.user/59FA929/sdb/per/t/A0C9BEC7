R is used extensively in academia and industry due to it's extremely strong set of statistical functions. R packages (extensions that can extend the capabilities of R) are generally written by academic statisticians, and as such are often of very high quality, and implement almost every type of statistics you can think of. R is based off a language called S, which in turn was built in C++. It is possible to run C++ directly in R, and most high performance packages (such as neural network implementations) use C++.\n\nR can technically perform any task that any other programming language can, although it's use is usually limited to the data exploration, analysis, and model building phases of a project. Implementation of models is usually left to another system or language. Everything that you would need to do in order to take data in a raw format, process it, visualise it, build a model, and then analyse the results can be done in R, with packages to make some jobs easier.\n\n# Getting Started With R\n\nIn order to get started using R, we'll need to download RStudio. The link below will take you to the download page. It shouldn't require administrator rights to install, but if it does, just ask IT.\n\n[https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)\n\nRStudio Desktop is completely free to use, and is open source (much like everything in R). Installing RStudio should also install the R compiler, so no further work is needed in order to run code.\n\nIn the console window, you can run single lines of code at a time, which is useful if you are just querying how to use a single function, or for a calculation. Alternatively, you can make an R Script by going to File -> New File -> R Script.\n\n# Libraries\n\nLibraries are extensions of R that perform specific procedures or add tools for you to use throughout your code. For example the library <tt> dplyr </tt> provides functions that make data manipulation much easier, we will use <tt> dplyr </tt> later on.\n\nTo install a library, we can use the command below. This can be run in the command line, or in an R Script (you can run a single line of a script by having your cursor on that line and pressing <tt>CTRL + ENTER</tt>).\n```{r,eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n```\nOnce the library has been successfully installed, you need to load the package into your R session using the command below. Note that once you exit RStudio, you will need to reload the packages you are using each time. However the installation only needs to happen once ever.\n```{r,eval = FALSE, include = TRUE}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\nPackages exist for almost everything you can imagine, some notable ones are below:\n\n* <tt>dplyr</tt>: Simple data manipulation. Adds SQL like verbs and a \"pipe\" operator to make code easier to read. Link [here.](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)\n* <tt>ggplot2</tt>: An extremely powerful plotting library for R. We will cover this in later sessions. Link [here.](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)\n* <tt>caret</tt>: Tools for classification and regression. Link [here.](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/caret/)\n* <tt>rpart</tt>: Implementation of CART decision trees in R. Link [here.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/index.html)\n\nCRAN is the central repository for R packages, and contains thousands of extremely useful packages that are freely available, chances if are if you need to do it there's already a package!\n\n\n\n",
